### Intro  
Hi there! I am a biomedical data scientist specializing in computational immunology and translational biomedical informatics. Currently, I am co-mentored by [Dr. Marylyn Ritchie](https://www.med.upenn.edu/pcpm/marylyn-d-ritchie-phd.html) and [Dr. John Wherry](https://www.med.upenn.edu/wherrylab/) at the University of Pennsylvania [Genomics & Computational Biology PhD Program](https://www.med.upenn.edu/gcb/). My current projects are in collaboration with [Dr. Allie Greenplate]() at the [Immune Health Project](https://www.med.upenn.edu/immunehealth/), [Dr. Joe Romano](https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/post-docs/joseph-d-romano), and [Dr. Jason Moore](http://epistasis.org/jason-h-moore-phd/) at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.

I also serve as the liaison between the [Philadelphia STEM Equity Collective](https://www.philastemeco.org/equity-collective) and the [Penn Interdisciplinary Network for Scientists Promoting Inclusion, Retention, and Equity](https://www.med.upenn.edu/pennINSPIRE/)

### Outside of Science:
My other interests include freelance scientific illustration, creating crowdsourced public art sculptures, and serving as the [Executive Director](https://www.villagebridges.org/our-team) of [Village Bridges](www.villagebridges.org), a social impact organization I co-founded with a team of young women from my village.
