Hi there! I am a biomedical data scientist specializing in computational immunology and translational biomedical informatics. Currently, I am co-mentored by [Dr. Marylyn Ritchie](https://www.med.upenn.edu/pcpm/marylyn-d-ritchie-phd.html) and [Dr. John Wherry](https://www.med.upenn.edu/wherrylab/) at the University of Pennsylvania [Genomics & Computational Biology PhD Program](https://www.med.upenn.edu/gcb/).
