# Van Quynh-Thi Truong, MS
### Intro  
Hi there! I am a biomedical data scientist pursuing my PhD at the University of Pennsylvania [Genomics & Computational Biology PhD Program](https://www.med.upenn.edu/gcb/), co-mentored by [Dr. Marylyn Ritchie](https://www.med.upenn.edu/pcpm/marylyn-d-ritchie-phd.html) and [Dr. John Wherry](https://www.med.upenn.edu/wherrylab/).

I also previously served as the liaison between the [Philadelphia STEM Equity Collective](https://www.philastemeco.org/equity-collective) and the [Penn Interdisciplinary Network for Scientists Promoting Inclusion, Retention, and Equity](https://www.med.upenn.edu/pennINSPIRE/)

### Outside of Science:
My other interests include freelance scientific illustration, creating crowdsourced public art sculptures, rock climbing, ultimate frisbee, camping, cooking, and serving as the [Executive Director](https://www.villagebridges.org/our-team) of [Village Bridges](https://www.villagebridges.org), a social impact organization I co-founded with a team of young women from my village.
